# Bidimensional Inverse Kinematic Haskell
Haskell implementation of inverse kinematics.
Contains function for calculating distance between points, points rotation ecc
Will try to make it an haskell package but i'm learning.

At the moment the library is capable of calculating rotation and distance, will implement inverse kinematics for n points.

TODO:
-[] change from main to something else and make it a module
-[] actual inverse kinematic function
-[] Graphical rappresentation maybe??
